# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Philosophy

This project takes security seriously. As an instruction system for GitHub Copilot, we're committed to ensuring that generated code follows security best practices and doesn't expose sensitive information.

## üîç Supported Versions

| Version | Supported | Status |
| ------- | --------- | ------ |
| Latest (main) | ‚úÖ | Active development, all security fixes |
| Previous releases | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Critical security fixes only |

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### **How to Report**

**Please DO NOT use public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security issues privately:

1. **Email**: Send details to [your-email@domain.com] with subject "SECURITY: GitHub Copilot Instructions"
2. **Encrypted Communication**: Use PGP if possible (key available on request)
3. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use the private vulnerability reporting feature

### **What to Include**
- **Description** of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Potential impact** assessment
- **Suggested fix** if you have one
- **Your contact information** for follow-up

### **Response Timeline**
- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Development**: Varies by severity (1-14 days)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and tested

## üîí Security Measures in Place

### **Automatic Protections**
- **Sensitive Data Exclusion**: Automatic exclusion of secrets, API keys, passwords
- **File Pattern Blocking**: Blocks processing of sensitive file types (.env, secrets.json, etc.)
- **Validation Framework**: Comprehensive security validation in best practices validator

### **Code Generation Security**
- **Input Validation**: All generated functions include comprehensive input validation
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling to prevent information disclosure
- **Type Safety**: Mandatory type hints to prevent type confusion vulnerabilities
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM patterns
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization patterns for web applications

### **Infrastructure Security**
- **No Remote Connections**: System works entirely locally
- **No Data Collection**: No telemetry or data collection
- **Clean Separation**: Clear boundaries between instruction logic and user code

## üéØ Security Best Practices Enforced

### **Authentication & Authorization**
```python
# Generated code always includes proper authentication patterns
@requires_authentication
def sensitive_operation(user: AuthenticatedUser, data: ValidatedInput) -> SecureResponse:
    """Example of security-first code generation."""
    if not user.has_permission('sensitive_operation'):
        raise PermissionDenied("Insufficient privileges")
    # ... secure implementation
```

### **Data Protection**
```python
# Automatic inclusion of data protection patterns
def process_personal_data(data: PersonalData) -> ProcessedData:
    """Process personal data with privacy by design."""
    # Input validation
    if not isinstance(data, PersonalData):
        raise ValueError("Invalid data type")
    
    # Data minimization
    minimal_data = data.extract_necessary_fields()
    
    # Processing with audit trail
    with audit_context("personal_data_processing"):
        result = process_data_securely(minimal_data)
    
    return result
```

### **Secure Configuration**
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All configuration through environment variables
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions in all generated code  
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security validation
- **Secure Defaults**: Security-first default configurations

## üîß Security Validation

### **Automated Checks**
The built-in validator performs security checks:

```bash
python .github/instructions/copilot_best_practices_validator.py
```

Security validations include:
- ‚úÖ No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- ‚úÖ Proper input validation patterns
- ‚úÖ Secure error handling (no information disclosure)
- ‚úÖ Authentication and authorization patterns
- ‚úÖ Data protection and privacy compliance

### **Manual Security Review**
For critical applications, we recommend:
1. **Static Analysis**: Use tools like bandit, semgrep
2. **Dynamic Testing**: Penetration testing of generated applications
3. **Code Review**: Human review of security-critical generated code
4. **Compliance Check**: Ensure generated code meets your compliance requirements

## üö´ Known Security Considerations

### **AI-Generated Code Limitations**
- **Context Dependence**: Security effectiveness depends on proper context
- **Domain Expertise**: Complex security scenarios may require human review
- **Testing Required**: All generated code should be thoroughly tested
- **Regular Updates**: Keep instruction system updated for latest security practices

### **User Responsibilities**
- **Environment Security**: Secure your development environment
- **Secret Management**: Use proper secret management tools
- **Code Review**: Review all generated code before production use
- **Testing**: Comprehensive security testing of applications
- **Updates**: Keep VS Code and GitHub Copilot updated
