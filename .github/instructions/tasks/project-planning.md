# Project Planning Instructions

## Objective
Guide project managers in creating comprehensive project plans, resource allocation, timeline management, and stakeholder coordination for data science and cloud projects.

## Key Principles
1. **Scope Definition**: Clearly define project objectives, deliverables, and success criteria
2. **Resource Planning**: Identify required skills, tools, and budget allocations
3. **Risk Management**: Proactively identify and mitigate potential risks
4. **Timeline Management**: Create realistic schedules with appropriate buffer time
5. **Stakeholder Alignment**: Ensure all stakeholders understand roles and expectations

## Planning Structure

### Project Charter
- **Problem Statement**: Clear business problem definition
- **Success Metrics**: Quantifiable KPIs and success criteria
- **Scope & Constraints**: What's included/excluded, technical constraints
- **Budget & Resources**: Cost estimates and resource requirements
- **Timeline**: High-level milestones and delivery dates

### Work Breakdown Structure
```
Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (2-3 weeks)
├── Requirements gathering
├── Data assessment
├── Technical architecture design
└── Risk assessment

Phase 2: Development (6-8 weeks)
├── Data engineering setup
├── Model development
├── Frontend development
└── Testing & validation

Phase 3: Deployment & Monitoring (2-3 weeks)
├── Production deployment
├── Monitoring setup
├── Documentation
└── Training & handover
```

### Resource Allocation Template
- **Data Scientists**: Model development, analysis
- **Data Engineers**: Pipeline development, data processing
- **MLOps Engineers**: Deployment, monitoring, CI/CD
- **Cloud Architects**: Infrastructure design, security
- **Frontend Developers**: UI/UX implementation
- **QA Engineers**: Testing, validation
- **Business Analysts**: Requirements, documentation

## Risk Management Framework
1. **Technical Risks**: Data quality, model performance, scalability
2. **Resource Risks**: Skill gaps, availability, budget overruns
3. **Timeline Risks**: Dependencies, scope creep, external factors
4. **Business Risks**: Changing requirements, stakeholder alignment

## Communication Plan
- **Daily**: Standup meetings with development team
- **Weekly**: Progress reports to stakeholders
- **Bi-weekly**: Sprint reviews and retrospectives
- **Monthly**: Executive summary and budget review

## Quality Gates
- Requirements sign-off before development
- Architecture review before implementation
- Data validation before model training
- Security review before deployment
- Performance testing before production release

## Documentation Requirements
- Project charter and scope document
- Resource allocation matrix
- Risk register and mitigation plans
- Communication matrix
- Project timeline with dependencies
- Budget tracking spreadsheet
- Weekly status reports
- Post-project retrospective

## Tools and Templates
- **Project Management**: Jira, Asana, or Microsoft Project
- **Documentation**: Confluence, Notion, or Google Docs
- **Communication**: Slack, Microsoft Teams
- **Version Control**: Git workflow coordination
- **Budget Tracking**: Excel/Google Sheets templates
