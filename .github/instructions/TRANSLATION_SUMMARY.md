## 📝 Template Format (Consistent)

### For Roles:
```markdown
# Research: Role: [Role Name]

Research specifically the [Role Name] role in GitHub Copilot:

REQUIRED ANALYSIS:
1. BEST PRACTICES (5 specific)
   - VS Code configurations optimized for [role-name]
   - Most effective instruction patterns
   - Integration with role-specific tools
   - High-performance prompt examples
   - Specific productivity metrics

2. CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERNS (5 critical)
   - Common instruction errors for [role-name]
   - Problematic configurations
   - Patterns that reduce effectiveness
   - Documented negative impact

3. ADVANCED RECOMMENDATIONS (5 advanced)
   - Role-specific optimizations
   - Tech stack integrations
   - Recommended workflows
   - Adoption strategies

CONTEXT: GCP data science project, inventory analysis
TECH STACK: Python, BigQuery, Vertex AI, Terraform, Jupyter
OBJECTIVE: Maximize [role-name] role productivity
```

### For Tasks:
```markdown
# Research: Task: [Task Name]

Research specifically the [Task Name] task in GitHub Copilot:

REQUIRED ANALYSIS:
1. BEST PRACTICES for [task-name]
   - Optimal instruction structure
   - Most effective keywords
   - Successful configuration examples
   - Prompt engineering patterns
   - Specific quality metrics

2. ANTI-PATTERNS for [task-name]
   - Common implementation errors
   - Counterproductive configurations
   - Frequently failing patterns
   - Performance issues

3. RECOMMENDATIONS for [task-name]
   - Advanced optimizations
   - Workflow integration
   - Complementary tools
   - Validation processes

CONTEXT: Data science in GCP
FOCUS: Specific [task-name] task with maximum effectiveness
```

## ✅ Quality Assurance

### Validation Results
- **Structure Validation:** ✅ PASS
- **Content Analysis:** ✅ PASS 
- **Coverage Analysis:** ✅ PASS (100% roles, 100% tasks)
- **Integration Assessment:** ✅ ANALYSIS COMPLETE

### Key Improvements Made
1. **Consistent English terminology** across all files
2. **Maintained technical accuracy** for GCP and data science context
3. **Preserved template structure** for easy processing
4. **Added missing task:** `context-management` research prompt
5. **Created comprehensive backup** for rollback if needed

## 🚀 Ready for Integration

The research prompts are now ready for integration with the main instruction system. Key benefits:

- ✅ **Professional English terminology**
- ✅ **Consistent structure** across all prompts
- ✅ **Complete coverage** of roles and tasks
- ✅ **Maintained context** specific to Gasco project
- ✅ **Backup available** for safety
