# **Project Manager: Prompt Examples**

## **1. Data Science Project Planning**

### **Prompt**

"Create a comprehensive project plan for a 6-month machine learning project to implement customer segmentation analysis. The project includes:
- Data discovery and exploration (4 weeks)
- Model development and validation (8 weeks)  
- Production deployment on GCP (4 weeks)
- User training and change management (4 weeks)
- Go-live and support (4 weeks)

Include deliverables, milestones, dependencies, resource requirements, and risk mitigation strategies. Use agile methodology with 2-week sprints."

## **2. Sprint Planning and Backlog Management**

### **Prompt**

"Organize the following features into a prioritized product backlog for a data analytics platform:
- User authentication and authorization
- Data ingestion from multiple sources
- Real-time dashboard creation
- Automated report generation
- Data export functionality
- Alert and notification system
- Mobile responsive design
- API development for third-party integration

Create sprint goals for the next 3 sprints (6 weeks total) with story point estimates and acceptance criteria."

---

## **3. Stakeholder Communication Plan**

### **Prompt**

"Develop a stakeholder communication plan for a cloud migration project moving our data infrastructure to Google Cloud Platform. Stakeholders include:
- Executive team (interested in timeline, budget, ROI)
- IT team (technical implementation details)
- End users (training and change impact)
- Compliance team (security and governance)
- External vendors (integration requirements)

Define communication frequency, channels, content, and escalation procedures for each stakeholder group."

---

## **4. Risk Management and Mitigation**

### **Prompt**

"Identify and assess risks for a machine learning deployment project. Create a risk register including:
- Technical risks (model performance, data quality, scalability)
- Operational risks (resource availability, timeline delays)
- Business risks (stakeholder buy-in, budget constraints)
- Compliance risks (data privacy, regulatory requirements)

For each risk, provide likelihood (1-5), impact (1-5), risk score, mitigation strategies, and contingency plans."

---

## **5. Project Status Reporting**

### **Prompt**

"Create a weekly project status report template for data science projects that includes:
- Executive summary with key achievements and blockers
- Sprint progress and velocity metrics
- Budget and resource utilization
- Timeline adherence and milestone tracking
- Quality metrics and technical debt
- Stakeholder feedback and action items
- Upcoming deliverables and dependencies

Format it for executive consumption with clear visual indicators (RAG status) and actionable insights."

---

## **6. Change Management Planning**

### **Prompt**

"Design a change management strategy for implementing a new data analytics platform that will replace existing Excel-based reporting processes. The change affects:
- 50+ business users across multiple departments
- Current manual reporting workflows
- Decision-making processes based on new real-time insights
- Training requirements for new tools and methodologies

Include change readiness assessment, training plan, communication strategy, and success metrics to ensure user adoption."
