# Quick Research Patterns

Fast research templates for common development scenarios.

## 🔍 Library Documentation Research
```
"[Library name] [specific functionality], use context7"

Examples:
- "pandas DataFrame validation methods, use context7"
- "plotly interactive dashboard components, use context7"
- "BigQuery ML model training, use context7"
```

## 📊 Codebase Analysis
```
"Analyze [pattern/functionality] with consult7 in [directory]"

Examples:
- "Analyze data cleaning patterns with consult7 in /src/data/"
- "Find testing patterns with consult7 in /tests/"
- "Review dashboard configurations with consult7 in /notebooks/"
```

## 🌐 Best Practices Research
```
"[Technology/method] best practices [year]"

Examples:
- "Python data validation best practices 2025"
- "GCP cost optimization strategies 2025"
- "Streamlit dashboard performance optimization 2025"
```

## 📂 Reference Implementation Search
```
"Find [implementation type] examples in [context]"

Examples:
- "Find ETL pipeline examples in data engineering projects"
- "Find API testing patterns in Python projects"
- "Find dashboard deployment strategies in production systems"
```

## 🚀 Combined Research Workflow
```
"[Your specific challenge]:
- [Business context]
- [Technical requirements]
- [Constraints]

use context7 for [primary technology]
Analyze [related patterns] with consult7 in [directory]
Research '[specific topic] best practices 2025'
Find [implementation examples] in similar projects"
```

## Time-Saving Shortcuts

### Quick Context Check
`"Current status of [topic], use context7"`

### Pattern Analysis
`"Similar implementations with consult7 in /src/"`

### Rapid Research
`"[Topic] latest trends 2025"`

### Reference Validation
`"Production examples of [implementation]"`
