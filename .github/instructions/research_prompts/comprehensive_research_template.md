# Comprehensive Research Template

Use this template for deep investigation of complex development challenges in the Gasco project.

## Research Query Structure

### Primary Investigation
- **Context**: [Describe the business or technical context]
- **Objective**: [What specific outcome are you seeking]
- **Scope**: [Define boundaries and limitations]

### MCP Tools Integration
1. **Context7**: `"[your query], use context7"`
2. **Consult7**: Analyze `/src/`, `/notebooks/`, `/data/` directories
3. **DuckDuckGo**: Search for current best practices and solutions
4. **GitHub**: Find reference implementations and documentation

### Research Pattern
```
Phase 1: Context Gathering
- Use Context7 for official documentation
- Analyze existing patterns with Consult7

Phase 2: Best Practices Research  
- Search current methodologies with DuckDuckGo
- Review industry implementations via GitHub

Phase 3: Synthesis and Implementation
- Combine insights from all sources
- Apply Gasco-specific requirements and constraints
```

## Usage Examples

### Data Science Research
```
"Implementing feature engineering for inventory forecasting:
- Context: Gasco inventory data with temporal patterns
- Objective: Predictive model for stock optimization
- Tools: pandas, scikit-learn, BigQuery
- Requirements: Real-time prediction capability

use context7 for pandas feature engineering
Analyze existing features with consult7 in /notebooks/
Research 'inventory forecasting feature engineering 2025'
Find ML pipeline examples in production systems"
```

### Infrastructure Research
```
"Designing scalable data pipeline architecture:
- Context: Daily inventory updates, multiple data sources
- Objective: Automated ETL with monitoring and alerting
- Tools: GCP services, Terraform, Cloud Functions
- Requirements: Cost optimization, fault tolerance

use context7 for GCP data pipeline patterns
Analyze current infrastructure with consult7 in /terraform/
Research 'GCP data pipeline best practices 2025'
Find similar architectures in enterprise projects"
```
